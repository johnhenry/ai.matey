# Specification Quality Checklist: Universal AI Adapter System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - Spec focuses on what/why, not how
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs - All user stories centered on developer needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - Language is accessible, avoids unnecessary jargon
- [x] All mandatory sections completed - User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria all present

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - All requirements are concrete
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous - Each FR has clear acceptance criteria
- [x] Success criteria are measurable - All SC items include specific metrics or conditions
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic - No mention of specific tech in SC section
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined - Each user story has Given/When/Then scenarios
- [x] Edge cases are identified - 7 edge cases documented
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded - Out of Scope section defines boundaries
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified - Both sections present and comprehensive

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria - 44 functional requirements defined with testable outcomes
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows - 6 user stories from P1 MVP to P3 advanced features
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria - 15 success criteria covering all aspects
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification - Maintained technology-agnostic language throughout

## Additional Items (from user input)

- [x] Testability requirements captured - Testing framework needs documented in dependencies and assumptions
- [x] Package publishing requirements captured - NPM package distribution mentioned in out of scope (handled in plan phase)

## Notes

All checklist items PASS. The specification is complete, technology-agnostic, and ready for the planning phase (`/speckit.plan`).

**User Request Integration**: The user requested making it testable using npm:test/npm:assert and making it an npm package ready for publishing. These are implementation details that will be addressed in the planning phase, not the specification. The spec correctly maintains technology-agnostic focus while the plan will specify:
- TypeScript as implementation language
- npm as package manager
- Node.js test runner and assert module for testing
- Package.json configuration for npm publishing

**Validation Results**: âœ… PASSED - All quality criteria met, no specification updates needed.
