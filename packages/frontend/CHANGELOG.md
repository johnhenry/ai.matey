# ai.matey.frontend

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 58ebc03: Streaming tool-call support end-to-end. OpenAI and Anthropic backends now emit `tool_use` IR chunks
  for streamed tool-call deltas (previously dropped with a console warning) and assemble complete
  `ToolUseContent` blocks on the final `done` chunk. The Anthropic backend reports the real
  provider stop reason (previously fabricated, e.g. `max_tokens` streams reported `stop`) and
  captures usage from every `message_delta`. The OpenAI backend folds the trailing
  `stream_options.include_usage` chunk into the done chunk. Frontend adapters re-emit tool deltas in
  native formats (OpenAI index-based `tool_calls` deltas; Anthropic `content_block_start`/
  `input_json_delta` events — the leading text block is now opened lazily so tool-only streams do not
  fabricate an empty text block). `StreamAccumulator` assembles streamed tool calls.

  Note: when tools are streamed, the done chunk's `message.content` is now a structured
  `MessageContent[]` (text + tool_use blocks) rather than a plain string, and finish reasons are now
  truthful (`tool_calls`/`length` where `stop` was previously reported).

- c7693ac: Complete non-streaming tool-calling support. The OpenAI backend now sends `tools`/`tool_choice`,
  converts assistant `tool_use` blocks to `tool_calls`, expands `tool_result` blocks into
  `role: 'tool'` messages, and parses `tool_calls` from responses (malformed arguments degrade to
  `{}`). The Anthropic backend now sends `tools`/`tool_choice`. Frontend adapters accept
  `tools`/`tool_choice` in their native formats and round-trip tool calls and tool results through
  the IR. OpenAI streaming requests now request usage accounting via `stream_options.include_usage`.

### Patch Changes

- e7df1d0: Remove vestigial `ai.matey.backend` runtime dependency from `ai.matey.frontend` (frontend adapters
  never imported it). Document `StreamToolUseChunk` delta semantics and add an optional `index` field
  identifying the tool call's position within the assistant message.
