# @johnhenry/aimatey-native-model-runner

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Republish from current main with a real fresh build.

  The 0.0.0 scope-import publishes (2026-08-26) shipped stale dist output --
  local npm publish without a rebuild, so the tarballs were missing everything
  after mid-July: the OmniRoute/GitHub Models/DashScope/Moonshot/SambaNova/
  Inception providers, litert-lm, the embeddings types module, and the
  provider-default-model fixes. This release republishes every package from
  current main (which also includes the 2026-08-26 audit fixes) via the CI
  release workflow, which always builds fresh before publishing.

### Patch Changes

  - @johnhenry/aimatey-errors@0.1.0

> Previously published as `ai.matey.native.model-runner`, last unscoped version `0.2.1`.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 73aa9f1: Fix broken CJS entry points across the whole package family. Every package declares
  `"type": "module"` for ESM subpath resolution, but shipped `dist/cjs/` builds with no nested
  override - Node walked up to the package root, saw `"type": "module"`, and misinterpreted the
  compiled CommonJS as ESM, so `require("ai.matey.x")` failed with `Cannot find module './y.js'`
  on every package in the family (ESM `import` was unaffected). Each package's build now emits a
  `dist/cjs/package.json` containing `{"type":"commonjs"}` (via a new
  `scripts/fix-cjs-package-json.js` post-build step) to correctly scope the CJS build's module
  type. No source or `exports` map changes - verified via `npm pack` + fresh install against the
  exact repro in #23, both direct `require()` and the `require` export condition on subpaths (e.g.
  `ai.matey.backend.browser/chrome-ai`).
