# ai.matey.native.node-llamacpp

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- 73aa9f1: Fix broken CJS entry points across the whole package family. Every package declares
  `"type": "module"` for ESM subpath resolution, but shipped `dist/cjs/` builds with no nested
  override - Node walked up to the package root, saw `"type": "module"`, and misinterpreted the
  compiled CommonJS as ESM, so `require("ai.matey.x")` failed with `Cannot find module './y.js'`
  on every package in the family (ESM `import` was unaffected). Each package's build now emits a
  `dist/cjs/package.json` containing `{"type":"commonjs"}` (via a new
  `scripts/fix-cjs-package-json.js` post-build step) to correctly scope the CJS build's module
  type. No source or `exports` map changes - verified via `npm pack` + fresh install against the
  exact repro in #23, both direct `require()` and the `require` export condition on subpaths (e.g.
  `ai.matey.backend.browser/chrome-ai`).

  (#23)

- Updated dependencies [73aa9f1]
  - ai.matey.errors@0.2.1
  - ai.matey.types@0.5.1
  - ai.matey.utils@0.4.2

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- New LiteRT-LM backend adapter: run Gemma on-device in the browser via WebGPU
  (`@litert-lm/core`, optional peer). Streaming-native with engine caching per model URL,
  AbortSignal cancellation, and semantic-drift warnings for the Web SDK's dropped features
  (sampler params, tools, non-text content). Registry entries for Gemma-4 E2B/E4B. Also:
  node-llama-cpp is now properly declared as an optional peer dependency of
  ai.matey.native.node-llamacpp.
- Updated dependencies
  - ai.matey.utils@0.4.1
